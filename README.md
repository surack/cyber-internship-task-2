# Cybersecurity Internship Task 2: Phishing Email Analysis

## Objective
Identify phishing characteristics in a suspicious email sample to build awareness of phishing tactics and improve email threat analysis skills.

## Steps Performed
1. Obtained a sample phishing email for analysis.
2. Examined the senderâ€™s email address and found signs of spoofing with misspelled domains.
3. Analyzed email headers with an online header analyzer, revealing discrepancies in sender fields and failed SPF/DKIM authentication.
4. Inspected links by hovering over them, discovering mismatched URLs leading to suspicious sites.
5. Noted the presence of an attachment (ZIP file) commonly used to deliver malware.
6. Identified urgent, threatening language intended to pressure the recipient.
7. Verified multiple spelling and grammar errors throughout the email.
8. Summarized all phishing traits found in the email.

## Key Phishing Indicators Found
- Spoofed sender address using lookalike domains
- Header anomalies in sender and reply-to fields
- Failed email authentication checks (SPF/DKIM)
- Mismatched and suspicious URLs
- Urgent language prompting immediate action
- Suspicious attachment potentially carrying malware
- Spelling and grammatical mistakes

## Conclusion
The email exhibits classic phishing tactics including spoofing, deceptive links, urgent threats, and poor language quality. Such emails are dangerous and should be treated with caution. This task enhanced my ability to detect phishing emails and strengthened my understanding of social engineering threats.
